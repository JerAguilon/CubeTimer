# CubeTimer
SpeedCube Timer

This is a basic Rubik's cube timer. Currently, it only supports 3x3, but it may be expanded simply by extending the Scrambler
class into a new file. Scrambles are visually displayed in another window by means of array manipulations in the CubeTwist class. 

For those interested, this was the first "large" (or so I thought) program that I built at the age of 17.
